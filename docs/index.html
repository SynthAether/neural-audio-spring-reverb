    <h1>Neural Audio Effects Modelling Strategies for a Spring Reverb</h1>
    
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Virtual analog modeling emulates the processing characteristics of a given physical device. This has been an active
        field of research and commercial innovation in which two main perspectives have been historically adopted. The first
        one: <strong>white-box</strong>, seeks to reproduce the exact behavior through algorithmic simulation of circuits or
        physical phenomena. The second one: <strong>black-box</strong>, aims to learn the approximation function from
        examples recorded at the input and output stages of the target device. In this second approach, deep learning has
        emerged as a valuable strategy for linear systems, such as filters, as well as nonlinear time-dependent ones like
        distortion circuits or compressors.</p>
    
    <p>The spring reverb is an audio effect with a very long and rooted history in music production and performance. Based
        on a relatively simple design, this device is an effective tool for artificial reverberation. The electromechanical
        functioning of this reverb makes it a nonlinear time-invariant spatial system that is difficult to fully emulate in
        the digital domain with white-box modeling techniques.</p>
    
    <p>This thesis aims to address the modeling of spring reverb, leveraging end-to-end neural audio effect architectures
        through supervised learning. Recurrent, convolutional, and hybrid models have successfully been used for similar
        tasks, especially compressor and distortion circuit emulations. Using two available datasets of guitar recordings,
        we evaluate with quantitative metrics, acoustical analysis, and signal processing measurements the efficiency and
        the results of four neural network architectures to model this effect. We present the results and outline different
        strategies for this modeling task, providing a reproducible experimental environment with code.</p>
